What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The structure is ready, but it yet has no documents as part of it, so I need to say to git what will be part of my repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is the working space. It allows you to modify files without effectivelly changing any previous commit or the working directory files.
