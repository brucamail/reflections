What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The structure is ready, but it yet has no documents as part of it, so I need to say to git what will be part of my repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is the working space. It allows you to modify files without effectivelly changing any previous commit or the working directory files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Add only the files involved in the change to commit

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When creating experimental changes, changing critical logics in the code, testing improvements.
Keeping changes on diferent pieces of code

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Makes it easier to understand what commit is reachable by every branch. Very useful for team coding.
